## Thesis
This repository contains my final Bachelor Thesis _'Hyperparameter Optimization for Jet Tagging'_ written in 2022 for the Artificial Intelligence major at the University of Amsterdam. This research was written and conducted at the European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. 

At the Large Hadron Collider protons are being accelerated and made to collide at speeds close to the speed of light; resulting into particle sprays known as jets. Determining which fundamental particle a jet originated from is known as _jet tagging_. In this thesis research, I attempt to increase performance of the state-of-the-art _Particle Transformer_ model, used to classify jets for the CMS experiment. This is done by using a centralized machine learning platform launched by CERN in 2021, to perform a hyperparameter optimization study.

Not all code is made public, only some of the train scripts and docker images used. Feel free to contact me for any questions regarding the code or thesis report.
